# Doom-Emacs-Configs

After reading about GNU and Linux union from both the creators. I started a journey to find GNU applications.
I landed on a very powerful, simple and extensive text editor, window manager and also an IDE. That is GNU Emacs.

Through my interaction with the software and listening to other programmers, i found The Church of Emacs and there i
pledged to use, distribute open and free software.

Unknowing, My journey did not end there. As linux has vast amounts of distributions/frameworks, so does GNU Emacs.

Introducing = Doom Emacs ( https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs )

Ofcourse, I installed it. Tweaked itto my preference and decided to keep a backup.

I have shared my config.el, init.el and package.el for anyone (open and free ) to clone, tweak and enjoy.
